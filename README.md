# Evezor-Stamp-STMF405
*please note this board is has been deprecated. 

The Evezor Stamp is a castellated carrier for the stmf405 chip with CAN networking and memory for Evezor's Edge network

The intent was that I could have this made by a higher quality shop with better pick and place machines than I had at the time. 
This was originally designed early in the pandemic and then the STM chips became completely unavailable. 
It worked pretty good, but in the end I'm glad I changed chipsets for a number of reasons. 
For one, I think I would have not liked using these so much. The boards I designed for this had this module on the back. Don't do double sided stuff unless absolutely necessary. Additionally, changing chips right in the early stages provided me with the knowledge of the location of the boundaries between chips. This was and is good knowledge.

I also developed a test and programming jig. It worked ok as well.
